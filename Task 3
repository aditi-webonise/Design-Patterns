Question 3
In the future it is expected that class ComputerEquipment will be extended with additional operations. The present structure of a computer equipment is assumed not to change. It is also not desired to ‘pollute’ all the existing component classes with new operations. 

a) Which design pattern would be suitable for this problem?

ANSWER:

I would use Decorator pattern for the above problem as it allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
